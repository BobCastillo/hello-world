Hello there! 

I'm Bob. I'm a business analytics student. I'm taking the "Data Science: Foundations using R" by John Hopking University in Coursera and this is part of the curriculum. I'm on the journey to become one of the best analysts in the Retail industry but I have still a long way to go. As they say, the journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step.
